# Source Restoration Needed

The working binary is at `/tmp/amble-lsp-working-with-npcs`

The source in `src/amble.rs` has compilation errors from cleanup attempts.

To restore:
1. The binary at /tmp/amble-lsp-working-with-npcs is WORKING
2. Copy it to bin/amble-lsp
3. The source needs to be reconstructed or use the binary as-is

The binary has all features working:
- Rooms, Items, NPCs
- Go To Definition
- Find All References
RESTORE

echo "Created RESTORE_NOTE.md"
echo "Please manually fix src/amble.rs or use the working binary from /tmp"
