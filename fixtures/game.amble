    blurb "A surreal sci-fi comedy adventure about cake, curiosity, and improbable facilities."
    intro """
You find yourself standing on a rocky outcrop of a ridge high in the mountains -- maybe the Andes? Emerging from a daze, you realize you were brought here and dropped off by some sort of flying vehicle. When it flew off, it didn't make a sound. Did it have a motor, or was it something different?

Your head gradually begins to clear, and you start to take stock of your surroundings...
