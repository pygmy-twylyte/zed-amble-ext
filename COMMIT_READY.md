## Files to Commit

### Core Implementation
- `language-server/src/amble.rs` - Main LSP implementation
- `language-server/tree-sitter-amble/` - Grammar binding
- `language-server/Cargo.toml` - LSP dependencies
- `src/lib.rs` - Extension implementation
- `Cargo.toml` - Extension config

### Configuration
- `.gitignore` - Properly excludes build artifacts
- `extension.toml` - Updated with LSP config
- `languages/amble/config.toml` - Language server reference

### Documentation  
- `README.md` - Updated with LSP features
- `LSP_README.md` - Detailed LSP docs
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Setup guide
- `SUCCESS.md` - Solution documentation
- `TREE_SITTER_MIGRATION.md` - Migration notes
- Plus other documentation files

### Build Tools
- `build.sh` - Build script
- `bin/.gitkeep` - Keeps bin directory in repo

### Tests
- `test_lsp.amble` - Basic tests
- `test_comprehensive.amble` - Comprehensive tests

## Known Issues
⚠️ language-server/src/amble.rs currently has compilation errors from cleanup attempt
- The WORKING binary is at `bin/amble-lsp` (currently in use by Zed)
- Source needs to be restored to match the working binary

## Recommendation
Either:
1. Quit Zed, copy working binary elsewhere, restore source, rebuild
2. Commit with note that source cleanup is in progress (CLEANUP_TODO.md)
